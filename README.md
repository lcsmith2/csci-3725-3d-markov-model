# CSCI 3725: Markov City
This script generates a "city" of the specified size using a Markov model to determine the heights and number of sides on each building that is created. 

The script is run inside Blender to generate a scene. To run it, open Blender and go to the text editor. Within the text editor,
open the script that was downloaded from this repository. Then, click the run script button.

For generating the examples, can we use different Markov models or should they all be done with the same one?
- Also have a variable that sets the size of the output
Can we have two separate Markov models - i.e. a second one for determining building color
